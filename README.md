## Google SERP checker

SEOBrowse is a browser build around keyword research. Every search query is clean, proxied through a geo-specific VPN, and runs in a clean browser session giving you trustworthy accurate search results. This matches with what the majority of users see and what automatic rank checkers (ahrefs, semrush, moz) report. Every search has easy access to your specific city, state, country, language and device.
